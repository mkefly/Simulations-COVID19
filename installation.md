Installation
============

:code:`covid19` is developed and tested with both Python 3.7+. In the
following, we assume you have a working python installation, 'python pip
<https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing)>'_,
and `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_. See :ref:`installing-python` for our
advise on installing anaconda python.

Clone the repository, install the requirements, and then install the software:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd covid19/
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ python setup.py install

Once you have run these steps, you have :code:`covid19` installed. You can now
try to run the examples.
